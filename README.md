# UVM 2018
Notes for UVM presentation

## What is the HAM DIET?

HAM = Harvard Art Museums  
DIET = Digital Infrastructure and Emerging Technology  

## Guiding Principles  
Organized data is infinitely malleable. Given the right situation, we can bend data to our will.  
There are no dead ends. The museums' data can be connected together endlessly.  
The digital equivalent/surrogate is as valuable, important, and useful as the real object.  
We should let computers do as much work for us as possible.  
Technology is awesome but has deep dark powers so be careful.  
Don’t try to get ahead of the curve but be ready to adapt to the curve when you run in to it.  
Technology is 90% people, 10% technology.  
Technology should be transparent to the user and when applied have a positive impact.  
Technology and data are not neutral. There is bias in it and everything we do. Be mindful of how this affects our work.  
Data is an immensely valuable type of information but it's not the only type. Use it to make data informed decisions, not data driven decisions.
